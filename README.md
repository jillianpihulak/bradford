##### Map Design
I decided to create a map with a vintage feel as a starting point for my final project. I used yellows, blues, and greens that I found on maps from the 1950's and 1960's to create an older feel. I found fonts (using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)) to create an older feel. For the water labels, I went for more of an older, nautical feel, and for the labels on land, I stuck to a similar style that I'd seen on vintage maps.

This particular map is to be used for a group project on fracking in Bradford County, PA in Human-Environment Geography.
